# HR-analytics
Data Preprocessing and ML model implementations for HR Analytics prediction


In this project, we attempt to predict when employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn. We aim to build other classification models like logistic regression, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Trees and others and also fine tune the parameters of the model. These models would be trained on a data set which will be engineered carefully after performing the feature engineering.
